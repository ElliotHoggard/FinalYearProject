# FinalYearProject
The following project uses machine learning to predict the results and scorelines of future Premier League fixtures. Multiple models were analysed including an Artificial Neural Network, Logistic Regression, a Support Vector Classifier, XGBoost and a Random Forest Classifier. The Regression method was then further developed utilising Sim√©on Denis Poisson and the probability mass function to predict fixtures. These models analyse the probabilities of fixtures against bookmakers using live betting data to determine if it is possible to produce a more accurate model using an enhanced dataset with ELO data, previous results and current form.
