# Premier League Prediction System
**A machine learning project that predicts Premier League Results and scorelines, modelling predominantly utilises regression techniques.**

**Project Description**

The following project uses machine learning to predict the results and scorelines of future Premier League fixtures. Multiple models were analysed including an Artificial Neural Network, Logistic Regression, a Support Vector Classifier, XGBoost and a Random Forest Classifier. The Regression method was then further developed utilising Siméon Denis Poisson and the probability mass function to predict fixtures. These models analyse the probabilities of fixture events against bookmakers using live betting data to compare accuracies and provide punt recommendations. Accurate predictions were made largely due to the enahnced dataset and data analysis that was conducted in development. Addtional features such as Goals Scored, Goals Conceded, Team Form, Cumulative Points, League Position and ELO ratings was added to the existing fixture dataset by football-data, this initial dataset is avilable from football-data (http://football-data.co.uk/data.php).

**Software Requirements**

- Python (version 3.9 is recommended)
- Chromedriver
- The Python libraries TKinker, Pandas, Numpy, MatPlotlib, Tensorflow, SciKit-Learn, XGBoost, SciPy and Selenium

**How to run the code**

1. Download all required software requirements
2. Clone this repository
3. Download the live betting data used, this is available from the Google Drive link [(link)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17G4Ipybt4XJ_EiGkWkl6vafQR2Nk7qH8).

The Build.exe located in the dist folder also runs the program. However, this lacks certain functionalities and isn't recommended.
