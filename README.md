# Premier League Prediction System
**A machine learning project that predicts Premier League Results and scoreline, predominantly using regression.**

**Project Description**

The following project uses machine learning to predict the results and scorelines of future Premier League fixtures. Multiple models were analysed including an Artificial Neural Network, Logistic Regression, a Support Vector Classifier, XGBoost and a Random Forest Classifier. The Regression method was then further developed utilising Sim√©on Denis Poisson and the probability mass function to predict fixtures. These models analyse the probabilities of fixture events against bookmakers using live betting data to compare accuracies and provide punt recommendations. Accurate predictions were made largely due to the enahnced dataset and data analysis that was conducted in development. Addtional features such as Goals Scored, Goals Conceded, Team Form, Cumulative Points, League Position and ELO ratings was added to the existing fixture dataset by football-data, this initial dataset is avilable from football-data (http://football-data.co.uk/data.php).

**Software Requirements**

- Python (version 3.9 is recommended)
- Chromedriver
- The Python libraries TKinker, Pandas, Numpy, MatPlotlib, Tensorflow, SciKit-Learn, XGBoost, SciPy and Selenium

**Installation instructions**

To run the application head to the dist folder where an executable exe called 'Build.exe' is located, this can be downloaded and ran without any software requirements. 

*Please note the exe file lacks certain functionalities due to compatibility issues, it is recommended to download all software requirements and run within a Python environment.*
